# Who am I serving pt.2
So it still comes back to this in the end. Who do I want to serve. Who should be my target audience. Now if butterbonds shall be my first project then that leaves 2 audiences who I can target. The customers or the business owners.

### The business owners
Let me start with exploring the needs and wants of the business owners and how that can line up with my needs and wants. The business owner wants to survive. The business owner wants more clarity. The business owner wants more customers. Their priorities right now would mainly be making sure they have enough cash to make it through this crisis, still being able to sell once the crisis is over, properly transitioning themselves to a more online model, exploring new revenue streams, ensuring the quality of their goods through delivery. Possible services that could be offered to them.
- Digital marketing
- Explanations of government stimulus packages and what they are eligible for
- Upgrading online ordering
- Upgrading systems for delivering take-away and delivered foods
- More promotion
- New website and social media

I feel as if I am late to the party on a lot of these needs. The other problem is a lot of these needs are a case by case basis and not very scalable. I myself do not know how to best implement a lot of these things and a lot of companies have already started doing so.

### The Customers
As I am writing this I think I have the idea that I will run with but in the spirit of the process I will still go through with this part. So what are the customers concerned about. Well I put up a reddit post on r/Perth asking what questions people had and although there was not a tonne of responses it was enough to go into three broad categories. The first was what is the best way to order to support the restaurants. The second is what hygiene standards have been put in place in restaurants in order to combat the spread. The final is for smoother online experiences, things such as prices in social media posts.

### What I am thinking
So here is what I am thinking. My position could be to help business’s meet customer expectations and through doing so hopefully help them gain more customers as well. What are customer expectations? Well it could be some kind of hygiene certification self-managed or audited that can give customers peice of mind. It could be helping with the online delivery and just cleaning up the services. It could be writing guides and operations sheets on how to best do certain process’s. It could be consulting work. What my next job is to do is to conduct a tonne of interviews and to reach out to a dream 100 and see where that leads me. 
### Goals
1. $1000 in revenue
2. 50 restaurants helped
3. 100 people following the story
