# Who Am I Serving
Who am I serving should have been the first question I asked as I began this endeavour. In the end no matter which direction I take it is the most impactful question on the journey. Whoever I am serving in this will allow me to drop my preconceived ideas and instead to only focus on what my customer actually needs. The question will answer what my format would be. Which direction I need to go. Who I need to talk to. What mediums I should be promoting on. Who am I serving.


There are 2 groups that I could serve with butter bonds. One is the general consumer, one is the restaurants. There is also a chance that there can be an overlap between them, or overflow from one purpose that can help the other. Yet the place I am now fully in the center is probably not where I need to be. I have felt that the two interviews I have done so far have been lacklustre. Neither being engaging for a business nor for a customer. The reason for this is that the questions were not pointed. I should be a discoverer. An adventurer an enquirer. __Perhaps before deciding who I wish to serve I must first ask who do I want to be.__


### So who am I then?
Well who am I not? I am not an expert in the field. Nor do I have any first hand experience. My competitive advantages are few. I am ambitious and I wish to see large scale impact  to my actions. What do I mean by large scale. I mean lives changed. I mean policy level. If I am honest I mean recognition and awards. I am a vain man. I do truly like to help and I am fine to give a lot with nothing in return feeling little regret over it. Yet I know myself enough to know I am not humble. I don’t think big impact and large scale recognition are requirements to start any venture yet for me I want to walk in a direction that if everything followed the best case scenario then there are at least options for it. I have no desire to be famous or be recognised on the streets though. Instead I want to be recognised well within an industry or for a particular skill. Yet that everybody within that industry in an area can at least recognise my name. 


##### The path to recognition
There are 2 ways to get that kind of recognition that I desire. One is to give so much of myself that I can no longer be ignored. The other is to be in a position of power or influence so that it is too costly for others to ignore me. Another thing about me is that I feel like I want to begin things. Yet I a have no large desire to run something. I have an urge for the new. Therefore the a position of power may not be suitable as that would require a long term investment. So what am I left with then. To create, to give, to educate. To provide so much value for an industry or sector that they are forced to look my way. I unaware if this is a healthy frame of mind to be in. If my drive should be so self centred and self focused. Yet at this stage in my life this is where I am at. This is who I am. I want to help others, I truly do but a large part of me does that for me and I need to come to terms with that.


Do I still want to think that way is a different question and can be answered at a different time.


### So then who shall I serve?
The question then is knowing all this is who shall I serve first. The ideas expressed above lead me to believe that all my energy and focus should be driven on one industry. That I should aim to make that industry my life-long pursuit so that my name will echo through time in that industry for centuries. The sentence before was far to dramatic for my liking. Anyway, even though the above leads me to think that something in my gut is telling me otherwise. It is telling me that the initial pursuit, the initial industry can just be a launching pad. A stepping stone to discover my true purpose. I guess the reason for this is because I have no clear idea what my purpose would be or what task to undertake if I had to choose one. I am unclear about my own personal strengths or passions. I am unclear in which direction I should go to find the sought after peace and fulfilment. Yet what I have been told and what I am inclined to believe is that opportunity finds those who are already in action. That momentum is unable to be built without motion. So what I should do first whilst can’t just be anything, the decision itself doesn’t necessarily mean everything.


So in my hubris I shall pick a challenge and attempt to serve both sides. Perhaps it will be a catastrophic failure. Perhaps it will lead me to success. I will see in the next couple of months. I am unsure if this will ever be published but if anyone is reading this and have come thus far please just remember this is all the enumerations of a 20 year old who still knows nothing of the world so take the melodrama with a grain of salt. Peace
